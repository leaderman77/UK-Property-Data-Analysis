# Project Name: UK Property Market Deep Dive
### Description
This repository presents an extensive analysis of the UK property market, leveraging large datasets to explore property prices, sales trends, and geographical distributions from 1995 to 2024. The project demonstrates sophisticated data handling skills, using Python and GeoPandas to manage and analyze approximately 10GB of property-related data. This work highlights adaptability in working with complex datasets, application of advanced analytical techniques, and geospatial data manipulation, providing insightful visualizations and actionable insights into the UK real estate market dynamics.

### Datasets Used
1. **Property Price Data**
   - **Source**: [UK Government's Price Paid Data](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/price-paid-data-downloads)
   - **Details**: This dataset contains records of UK property transactions from June 9, 1995, to May 30, 2024, including prices and transaction types.

2. **Postcodes (NSPL)**
   - **Source**: [ONS Geoportal NSPL](https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/datasets/f7464f3658ba439ba577651b32014cfe/about)
   - **Details**: The National Statistics Postcode Lookup (NSPL) provides a comprehensive list of postcodes in the UK along with corresponding administrative, health, and other geographic areas.

3. **British National Grid Shapefiles**
   - **Source**: [OSGB Grids on GitHub](https://github.com/charlesroper/OSGB_Grids?tab=readme-ov-file)
   - **Details**: Shapefiles for the British National Grid, used for detailed geospatial analysis and mapping at a 10km resolution.

### Technologies Used
- Python: For data manipulation and analysis.
- Pandas and GeoPandas: Used for handling large datasets and performing spatial data analysis.
- Matplotlib and Seaborn: For creating visualizations.
- Jupyter Notebooks: For documenting the analysis process step-by-step.
Here are a few key visualizations created during this analysis:

### Key Insights
- Trends Over Time: Analysis of property price fluctuations and trends from 1995 to 2024.
- Regional Analysis: Detailed breakdown of property sales and price trends by regions and boroughs, highlighting areas with significant growth or decline.
- Geospatial Distribution: Mapping the density and distribution of property sales using the British National Grid system to identify hotspots and areas of low activity.
- Seasonal Patterns: Examination of how property sales vary with seasons and major economic events.

### Challenges and Solutions
- Handling Large Datasets: Techniques for managing and analyzing large datasets efficiently using Python and pandas.
- Data Cleaning: Strategies for dealing with missing data, duplicates, and anomalies in real estate transactions.
- Geospatial Analysis: Overcoming complexities in merging datasets with different geographic codings using GeoPandas.

### Future Work
- Predictive Modeling: Developing models to predict future trends in property prices.
- Expanded Geographic Analysis: Including additional geographic regions and comparing urban vs. rural trends.
- Integration with Other Data Sources: Combining this data with Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs), economic indicators or demographic data to enrich the analysis.
